# Airbnb Clone Project üè°

Welcome to the Airbnb Clone Project! This project aims to recreate the functionality of Airbnb using the MERN stack, showcasing expertise in full-stack development and modern web technologies.

## Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is an ongoing endeavor to build a fully functional web application similar to Airbnb. It utilizes the MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, to create a robust and scalable platform for property rentals.

### Current Progress

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing property listings, user data, and booking information.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for building the API backend and routing.
- **React.js:** JavaScript library for building the client-side user interface.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Bootstrap:** Frontend framework for designing responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
- **Vite:** Frontend build tool for fast and efficient development and bundling of React components.
